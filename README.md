### What is this repository for? ###

* This is a portefolio repo to allow external peek into some of my data analytic work.
* These are case financial analysis aimed at building a prediction model on high beta stocks.
* Since the data sets are mostly timeseries, analysis are made with ARIMA style models.

* Tronox.ipynb is the most comprehensive notebook to understand the process
* Chemours.ipynb was made after Tronox.ipynb to assess Chemours stock potential.
* Food_Can_1stRound.ipynb is interesting from a data visualation standpoint.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Install Anaconda or miniConda to create virtual environment and manage package easily
* Create a venv using the requirements.txt as a reference to install required dependencies ($ conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt)
* You will also need FinForecast Module available here https://github.com/joboll/FinForecast
